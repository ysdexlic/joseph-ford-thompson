          I am a User Experience obsessive. Having recently completed a course at the Interaction Design Foundation where I placed in the top 10 of all UK Course takers for Psychology of Interaction Design, I am looking to start my career as a UX Designer. I am a creative worker, confident communicator and a lifetime geek.

          I believe in the power of excellent, emotionally engaging design for real humans. Humans that get stressed. Humans that are busy. Humans that walk into a room and forget what they went in there to do. Good design massages these pain points, and gives a helpful point in the right direction - and that engenders gratefulness, trust, and (if it’s done really well) delight. That is my motivation - I believe in making sure that the technology we create should be as kind and humane as our intentions.

          This isn’t just flowery talk. It’s good business. Studies have shown that it can be anywhere from 5-25 times more expensive to find a new customer than to retain an existing one. If our design can engender and build trust with our users, they’ll forgive smaller mistakes, and be far more likely to recommend our product.
